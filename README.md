# The DuckDB Avro Extension
This repo contains a DuckDB community extension that enables DuckDB to *read* [Apache Avro (TM)](https://avro.apache.org) files. Avro is the (self-declared) "leading serialization format for record data". Avro is a self-describing *row-major* binary table format. This is in contrast to the (much more popular) Parquet format that is *columnar*. Its row-major design enables Avro - for example - to handle appends of a few rows somewhat efficiently. 

The extension does not contain Avro *write* functionality. This  on purpose, by not providing a writer we hope to decrease the amount of Avro files in the world over time. 

### Installation & Loading
Installation is simple through the DuckDB Community Extension repository, just type

```
INSTALL avro FROM community;
LOAD avro;
```
in a DuckDB instance near you. There is currently no build for WASM because of dependencies (sigh).

### The `read_avro` Function
The extension adds a single DuckDB function, `read_avro`. This function can be used like so:
```SQL
FROM read_avro('some_example_file.avro');
```
This function will expose the contents of the avro file as a DuckDB table. You can then use any arbitrary SQL constructs to further transform this table.


### File IO
The `read_avro` function is integrated into DuckDB's file system abstraction, meaning you can read Avro files directly from e.g. HTTP or S3 sources. For example

```SQL
FROM read_avro('http://blob.duckdb.org/data/userdata1.avro');
FROM read_avro('s3://my-example-bucket/some_example_file.avro');
```

should "just" work. 

You can also *glob* multiple files in a single read call or pass a list of files to the functions:

```SQL
FROM read_avro('some_example_file_*.avro');
FROM read_avro(['some_example_file_1.avro', 'some_example_file_2.avro']);
```

If the filenames somehow contain valuable information (as is unfortunately all-too-common), you can pass the `filename` argument to `read_avro`:

```SQL
FROM read_avro('some_example_file_*.avro', filename=true);
```
This will result in an additional column in the result set that contains the actual filename of the Avro file. 

### Schema Conversion
This extension automatically translates the Avro Schema to the DuckDB schema. *All* Avro types can be translated, except for *recursive type definitions*, which DuckDB does not support.

The type mapping is very straightforward except for Avro's "unique" way of handling `NULL`. Unlike other systems, Avro does not treat `NULL` as a possible value in a range of e.g. `INTEGER` but instead represents `NULL` as a union of the actual type with a special `NULL` type. This is different to DuckDB, where any value can be `NULL`. Of course DuckDB also supports `UNION` types, but this would be quite cumbersome to work with. 

This extension *simplifies* the Avro schema where possible: An Avro union of any type and the special null type is simplified to just the non-null type. For example, an Avro record of the union type ` ["int","null"]` becomes a DuckDB `INTEGER`, which just happens to be `NULL` sometimes. Similarly, an Avro union that contains only a single type is converted to the type it contains. For example, an Avro record of the union type ` ["int"]` also becomes a DuckDB `INTEGER`.

The extension also "flattens" the Avro schema. Avro defines tables as root-level "record" fields, which are the same as DuckDB `STRUCT` fields. For more convenient handling, this extension turns the entries of a single top-level record into top-level columns.

### Implementation
Internally, this extension uses the "official" [Apache Avro C API](https://avro.apache.org/docs/++version++/api/c/), albeit with some minor patching to allow reading of Avro files from memory.

### Limitations & Next Steps
- This extension currently does not make use of **parallelism** when reading either a single (large) Avro file or when reading a list of files. Adding support for parallelism in the latter case is on the roadmap. 

- There is currently no support for neither projection nor filter **pushdown**, but this is also planned at a later stage.

- There is currently no support for the WASM or the Windows-MinGW builds of DuckDB due to issues with the Avro library dependency (sigh again). We plan to fix this eventually.

- As mentioned above, DuckDB cannot express recursive type definitions that Avro has, this is unlikely to ever change.

- There is no support to allow users to provide a separate Avro schema file. This is unlikely to change, all Avro files we have seen so far had their schema embedded.

- There is currently no support for the `union_by_name` flag that other readers in DuckDB support. This is planned for the future.
